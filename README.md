# Spoofr
Spoofr uses algorithms to randomize things like the UserAgent, keypresses, and spoofs web traffic and date. It works best as a userscript or a Chrome extension. [Find a JSFiddle here.](https://jsfiddle.net/nathanaccidentally/ty5jLhxm/)

I will most likley not be continuing development on this little project. Feel free to do whatever with it (fork it, put it in your own project, burn it on a cd and give it to your cat), I don't care.
